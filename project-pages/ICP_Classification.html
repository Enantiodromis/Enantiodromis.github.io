            A dataset was constructed, comprising of synchronized data from
            a non-invasive optical sensor and an invasive gold standard intracranial pressure monitor from
            31 patients. From this data, 202 features were extracted for each one-minute window of non-
            invasive data. A total of 25 classification models were evaluated. <br><br>The results demonstrate
            the potential of photoplethysmography data in accurately classifying normotensive and hy-
            pertensive intracranial pressure levels. The optimal model achieving an accuracy of 85.74%.
            The reported F1 scores further validate the studyâ€™s efficacy with 85.75% and 85.69% for nor-
            motensive and hypertensive classes respectively. This study establishes a credible foundation
            for further research in this field.<br><br> These initial findings pave the way for the development and
            testing of regression models for intracranial pressure assessment ultimately leading towards the
            aim of developing continuous, non-invasive intracranial pressure monitoring techniques.
