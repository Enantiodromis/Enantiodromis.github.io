          <div class="body-text">A clinical dataset was compiled, comprising synchronised data from a non-invasive optical sensor and an invasive gold standard ICP monitor from 27 patients. 
            Two datasets, derived from short and long-distance NIRS, were generated from this data. For each dataset, 141 features were extracted for every one-minute window of non-invasive data. 
            A total of 5 classical regression models were implemented, optimised and assessed. The study aimed to evaluate the models’ performance for the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of ICP using a leave-one-patient out cross validation approach. 
            <br><br>Feature selection was conducted using recusive feature elimination, using a leave one group out cross validation scheme. Each models' hyperparameters were opitmised using Optuna a Bayesian optimisation framework.
            The 5 models were trained and evaluated on both the long and short distance NIRS data. The lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were obtained using features derived from long-distance NIRS. A Random Forest (RF) model achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE of 5.030 and 4.067 mmHg respectively. The RF exhibited wide limits of agreement with the reference method. This was reflected in the 95% Bland–Altman limits of agreement, ranging from 8.782 to -8.487 mmHg.
            <br><br>
            This research brings novel insights to non-invasive ICP monitoring through the investigation of the largest clinically collected NIR-PPG dataset from patients with severe TBI and invasive ICP monitoring and the investigation into the possibility of predicting ICP non-invasively using exclusively morphological and time series features from NIRS-PPG. This research area is nascent and evolving and future work is required. The outcomes of this study provide a solid groundwork for future research within this domain.</div>
