        <span class="subheader-text">My Background / About Me</span>
        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I am currently a doctoral researcher at City University's Research Centre for Biomedical Engineering, with a research focus on neurocritical care. Before this, I obtained a master's degree in artificial intelligence from King's College London, and prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Newcastle University.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Research summary:</b> My research aim is the creation of a non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement algorithm, utilising photoplethysmography (PPG) signals collected from the forehand. ICP monitoring is a “gold standard” monitoring modality for severe TBI patients. The current monitoring technique for ICP is through the insertion of a probe through the skull in a procedure under a general anaesthetic. Efficacious ICP monitoring and intervention at clinically defined thresholds may reduce mortality and secondary injury to the brain. Current ICP monitoring is an invasive, high risk and expensive procedure which requires a high level of expertise as well as only being accessible in a hospital setting. My hope is to produce the first effective, non-invasive ICP measurement algorithm helping reduce the cost and complexity of ICP monitoring, consequently reducing the barrier to entry to efficacious monitoring, screening and intervention for patients and healthcare systems, perhaps helping towards the realisation of a "roadside" to "bedside" product.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I am really excited about how AI and data can help transform healthcare. I am particularly interested in the shift away from exclusively in-hospital care through non/minimally invasive, continuous and ubiquitous physiological monitoring and patient care.   <br><br>Away from my computer I enjoy cycling, BJJ and most things water related, but especially freediving and spearfishing.</div>
